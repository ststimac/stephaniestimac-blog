In 2021 I only read 6 out of 12 books for my reading challenge. Though to be fair, 4 of those books were 900-1000+ page books (The final 4 books of [The Wheel of Time](https://amzn.to/3jj2mMG)). In 2020 I read even less, but pre-2020 I was reading upwards of 24 books a year. In an effort to try to get back to that this year, I prioritized reading in the second half of the year and read 13 of my 12 books and I’ve got a few others in progress. 

I like to read multiple books at once because what I want to read varies depending on my mood. 

In terms of what I like to read, I’ve discovered that my book genres tend to be historical, fantasy and varying non-fiction around self-improvement. I find it really hard to get into your average fiction book. I tried a few times this year and abandoned a few. 

With that, I want to highlight a few of my favorite reads this year: 

## Most educational: [_Just Keep Buying: Proven Ways to Save Money and Build Your Wealth_](https://amzn.to/3YYQjVo) by Nick Maggiulli 

I have a tricky relationship with money and investing and this book helped me feel better about investing. Even if you put $20 toward investments in the stock market, the idea that you should just keep buying no matter if the market is up or down was spelled out clearly. It also details the different types of investment avenues as well as when you should save more or invest more. 

## Best Story: [_The Name of the Wind_](https://amzn.to/3GtAm2k) and [_The Wise Man’s Fear_](https://amzn.to/3WSMIq4) by Patrick Rothfuss 

After finishing the Wheel of Time I was on the hunt for a new fantasy book to fill the hole that it left after finishing it (and it’s a big hole, with so many books.) Patrick Rothfuss’ books were recommended to me. So I started book one and then I was hooked. I read book two and I read it knowing book 3 hasn’t been finished. I am on pins and needles for book 3. It’s opposite The Wheel of Time, in terms of length. Only 3 books but a fantastic read. It makes me wish there were more books planned! But it is very hard to write a book, let alone a series (Oh hey GRRM) so I’ll just bide my time with other books while I wait for book 3.

## Best history read: [_How Iceland Changed the World: The Big History of a Small Island_](https://amzn.to/3Q0aQoi) by Egill Bjarnason 

I was so enamored with Iceland by the end of my trip in September I started looking for history books about the island and found this one. Unlike some history books I’ve read this one was easy to follow and covered quite a bit in under 300 pages. There’s a lot of interesting history about Iceland and its role in global politics. It was a great read. 

## The rest of my list

Here's the rest of my list. A few were reads to just get me in the habit of reading again. Some were driven by a desire to better myself and understand anxiety in my relationships (romantic and friendly). I have queue of books to read in the new year though and I'm looking forward to carving out more time for it, especially on long flights!

- Women & Power: A Manifesto 
- Dopamine Detox: A Short Guide to Remove Distractions and Get Your Brain to Do Hard Things
- Bad Days in History: A Gleefully Grim Chronicle of Misfortune, Mayhem and Misery for Every Day of the Year 
- Notes on a Nervous Planet 
- The Plantagenets: The Warrior Kings and Queens Who Made England 
- Life is Short and So Is This Book
- How to Let Him Go: Using Attachment Theory to Understand Unhealthy Relationship Behaviors and Change Them
- Shield Maiden: Under the Howling Moon
- Shield Maiden: Under the Hunter's Moon
