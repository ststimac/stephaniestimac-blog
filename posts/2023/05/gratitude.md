Routine is incredibly important, and its importance is something I didn't quite grasp until recently. When your routine is in chaos, it can affect your life leading to a decline in mental and physical health. 

At the start of 2021, I started a gratitude journal. My divorce has been finalized in 2020, and I'd been in a relationship for 13 years so I was still trying to navigate relationships and disappointment and figuring out what "normal" life was. So, I started a gratitude journal as a habit.

I was determined to write down 3 things every day that I was thankful for. Overall, I've been pretty consistent. There have been times of chaos where I just haven't had the time or space to do so religiously (particularly the past year) but I have kept doing it even if it wasn't every day. 

In the last 3 weeks I have been consistent and find myself gravitating to my journal as a way to re-establish routine and what's important. I've come to realize is that gratitude is key to be okaying with what's happening in your life. It helps you reframe everything and operate within a state of grace. 

There are always things to be thankful for, even in the most grim of times or when things seem impossible. It helps keep you optimistic, and for me that's been key to navigating the layoffs with Rapid and move forward even when I have moments of panic. Everything will be okay. 

Today:
I'm thankful that the sun is shining in Berlin again. 
I'm thankful for the ability to share and ask for help within the Rapid Alumni Slack group.
I'm thankful for a slow day where I have no commitments.
