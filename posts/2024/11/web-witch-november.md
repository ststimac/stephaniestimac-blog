I am writing this from the desert where we've had a lovely few days of food and football (both American and English). I've found this trip a bit harder to adjust to the timezone and environment and have been struggling with energy levels so we haven't gone biking. It could just be my body's way of forcing me to rest as the year winds down.

November's energy definitely brought a lot of slowing down and cozy vibes but also lots of productivity. I have lots of things in the works that I'm planning to launch in 2025 (one might launch in December, we'll see!) I did restart my newsletter, [Web Witch Weekly](https://webwitchweekly.beehiiv.com/) at the end of the month and am looking forward to continuing that. I would love it if you would subscribe. 


## HYBYCOZO at the Desert Botanical Garden
The Phoenix Desert Botanical Garden is currently full of an exhibit by one of my favorite artists, [HYBYCOZO](https://www.hybycozo.com/), and while it is usually tradition to go for the holiday lights, we just decided to just go for the HYBYCOZO exhibit. I'm so glad we did! The geometric light sculptures amidst the desert landscape were really dreamy.

The exhibit goes through January 20, 2025.

## Web Platform Offsite in London
Earlier this month, the Web Platform team at Igalia met in London for a few days of team time. This time in-person is so valuable with our remote work environment. I helped organize the event and whew, is that stressful. I think I have a few lessons for planning and organizing next time.

## Currently... 
### Watching
We finished _The Penguin_ and really enjoyed where it ended. It's one of those series that could continue but was also wrapped up in a way that it could have been a limited run. 

We started _Dune: Prophecy_ and while we are only one episode in, I thought it was really good, so I'm hoping the rest of the season follows suit. 

Unapologetically, I have binged seasons 2-4 of _Real Housewives of Salt Lake City_, largely encouraged by the fact Jhey and I were both ill for a few days and absolutely incapacitated. _Real Housewives of Beverly Hills_ just started and episode 1 has hints of being better than last season. Fingers crossed. 

A quick honorable mention to _Vanderpump Rules_, whose cast is being completely revamped after 12 seasons. Thanks for bringing absolute chaos to my TV. 

### Playing
I finished playing [_The Legend of Zelda: Echos of Wisdom_](https://amzn.to/4eFtIo9) and am most heartbroken that it is over. I've been going around trying to collect things, and one thing I wish I had known was just how more intertwined side quests are with the main quest. I think I would approach playing the game completely differently had I known this. 

I have [_Skyward Sword_](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch/) for the Switch, so I may embark on that journey as I never actually played the final boss when that was on Wii.


### Reading 
**Finished**: 
- [Nine Years Among the Indians, 1870-1879: The Story of the Captivity and Life of a Texan Among the Indians](https://amzn.to/4f4h9lW) 
- [The Ashes and the Star-Cursed King (Crowns of Nyaxia Book 2)](https://amzn.to/3NQYej0)
- [Quicksilver](https://amzn.to/3D3GHBZ)
- [Six Scorched Roses (Crowns of Nyaxia Novella)](https://amzn.to/3Ztzqo2)

I finished my history book and then let the romantasy take over. I found _Quicksilver_ to be a bit of a slow start and a bit of a weird pace and then was fully consumed by it and couldn't put it down. These books are so easy to consume. It's great.

**Started**:
- [The Songbird and the Heart of Stone (Crowns of Nyaxia Book 3)](https://amzn.to/3CQGzWJ)

This is book 29 of my goal of 30! Very excited that I ended up smashing this goal.

### Vlogging
The vlog took a holiday turn and I'm happy with the latest one I've posted. I get a little bit ASMR with it and take viewers along for one of my Kobido Bedford appointments. I think I've finally landed on a cover font too.

## Other Bits

I am on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/seaotta.dev), [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@stephanie.m.stimac) and [Mastodon](https://toot.cafe/@seaotta). I still have my X account (Twitter is long dead), but have locked my account and am not posting there. I downloaded my data and perused old tweets that I was able to find again (search has been broken on X for a long time), and it really stood out to me how much more lively and fun the place used to be.
