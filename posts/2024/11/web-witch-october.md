October was once again a blur in which I tried to soak up all the autumn vibes in between trips. I headed back to Seattle & Bellingham for another wedding party in the bestie group. 

I managed to snap a very faint photo of the aurora from Alki beach while back home in the UK, Jhey got a full light show, no camera needed. Figures!

I attended AWE EU, which is my first event in a long time that puts me back on booth duty. It was honestly a bit nice to not have to worry about giving a talk. I quickly flew back home in time for Halloween, and I am so glad I did as we had so many trick or treaters. I was delighted. 

Living abroad means needing to make sure I have ample time to prepare my ballot for voting. I sent my ballot in mid-October and was thrilled to see my vote counted a week later.

On the eve of the US Election, if you have voting rights in the US, I implore you to exercise your right to vote. It is a privilege to do so. In a race that should not be close, but is, your vote and your voice absolutely matters.  



## Currently... 
### Watching
May I once again implore you to watch _The Penguin_? Colin Farrell is so, so good. We're still making our way through that. Our "watched" list for October is much longer, movie-wise, than normal.

I think we proceeded to check off all my October Halloween movies and then some. 
- Hocus Pocus 
- Hocus Pocus 2 (I don't think I'll ever watch this again)
- Practical Magic 
- Rocky Horror Picture Show
- Clue 
- Alien, Aliens, Alien: Resurrection, Alien: Romulus 
- The Lost Boys 

I am very much _not_ a horror movie person so we keep it light. Except for Alien. I am weirdly fine with Alien. 

### Playing
[The Legend of Zelda: Echos of Wisdom](https://amzn.to/4eFtIo9) - still plugging along through this delight of a game. It's even inspired some thoughts on design systems (tbw).

Jhey purchased a Steam Deck and is on his own game journey now. 

### Reading 
**Finished**: 
- [The Serpent and the Wings of Night (Crowns of Nyaxia #1)](https://amzn.to/40t7hOX)
- [House of Earth and Blood (Crescent City #1)](https://amzn.to/4045642)

_The Serpent and the Wings of Night_ series was an absolute delight and surprise that I added from Kindle Unlimited. I very much enjoyed book 1 and promptly downloaded book 2. I told myself I couldn't buy book 2 of Crescent City until I finished Serpent/Wings of Night, and, well, joke's on me. I will read that series before I continue on with Crescent City.

**Started (and/or continued)**:
- [Nine Years Among the Indians, 1870-1879: The Story of the Captivity and Life of a Texan Among the Indians](https://amzn.to/4f4h9lW) 
- [The Ashes and the Star-Cursed King (Crowns of Nyaxia Book 2)](https://amzn.to/3NQYej0)

Reading was a little slow at the first half of the month. I hope to catch up this month. I set a goal of 30 books for the year, and I've made it through 24. 

### Vlogging
Trying to vlog and edit while on the go is really hard, but I still managed to get some vlogs out. Folks seem to like the Seattle vlog.
