My goal for 2023 was to read 24 books. I read 21, just shy of 22. I don't get particularly hung up on whether or not I met my goal unless it's really abysmally off target. I ended up reading many 700+ page fantasy books this year so when I average that out, that's nearly 3 "normal" books. 

I didn't read as many educational or historical books this year. I was largely in an escapist mood. 

## Most unique read: [_Wild: Tales from Early Medieval Britain_](https://amzn.to/47iPM3t) by Amy Jeffs

When I picked this up in a London bookshop I thought it was a historical account of early Britain, and in a way it is. The English Literature student in me found a bit of a refreshing change though, and while the book takes poems and stories from early Britain, the author provides a follow up essay for each one. Breaking it down, reflecting on the circumstances and period when the piece was written. Nature and the wild are the underlying themes of the stories shared. It took me back to my school days when we would have to write papers, analyzing a work. 

A different kind of book, for those who love art and nature.

## Best story: [_The Way of Kings: The Stormlight Archive_](https://amzn.to/3NOQLSa) by Brandon Sanderson

Craving a new fantasy adventure, I finally started a Brandon Sanderson series, _The Stormlight Archive_, and after a bit of a slow start, was immediately hooked. _The Wheel of Time_ has been my big fantasy series I didn't want to let go of, with a fear I'd be disappointed by other series. Well, I'm not disappointed except for the fact there's only 4 books out of the 10 planned (number 5 is set to arrive in 2024!) 

## Most helpful: [_The Gifts of Imperfection_](https://amzn.to/3O9UIB9) by Bren√© Brown 

A great and short read about authenticity and staying true to yourself. This was an impactful read for me and while not related to interviewing for jobs, it has helped me remember to stay true to myself when interviewing and answering questions.

### All the others 

Lots of fantasy novels and a few re-reads. I started the Outlander series once again and am just getting through the last two books published in the series. I hadn't read them yet (not on this list). The Wheel of Time has been a joy to rediscover in audiobook form. So many new things I pick up on in this form.

My goal for 2024 is 30 books. "But you didn't even reach your goal for 2023!" you might say. I want prioritize reading more and less scrolling. The last few weeks of the year there has been too much scrolling. Upping the goal helps kick me into gear. 

A gentle reminder I'd like to leave you with: reading is meant to be enjoyed. It's okay to abandon a book that isn't keeping your attention and move onto something different. Enjoy the read, don't force it. 

Happy 2024.
