I'm not so sure I like calling these "Life checks"...perhaps going forward I will call them something else. Maybe time to bring back _The Web Witch's Grimoire_ but make it monthly. 

Much to my dismay, it's already September, and I'm sat here looking back on the last three months thinking, "did that go the way you expected it to?" And the answer is yes it did. I feared the amount of travel would make it go by quickly, and it did. 

It feels as if I have crammed 6 months of life into 3 months.  

## Seattle, Whistler, and Pennsylvania
I started August by flying out to Seattle and going up to Whistler, Canada for a joint bachelorette weekend. I have not seen most of my friends since last November, so it was lovely. We paddle boarded in a glacier fed lake and also had floating charcuterie which we've now called "lakecuterie"...we're also wondering why this is the first time we'd thought of this incredible way to make a paddle board day more enjoyable. 

We spent the next day at the [Scandinave Spa](https://www.scandinave.com/whistler). I was a bit worried about not being able to talk inside the spa but what ensued was the most blissful 5 hours of digital detox and relaxation time. I am now trying to ensure I have active digital detox time & would like to regularly sauna/cold plunge. That combo is amazing for my nervous system. 

I then flew out to Pennsylvania for my brother's baby shower, however, their little one arrived 7 weeks early and in addition to the baby shower I got to meet my niece. I cried as I met her in the NICU and had a lovely moment with my brother. My sister and mom had flown out too, so it was a nice weekend, but I was tired & by the time I got back to England, I was exhausted. 

## Life in the UK
I'm driving a bit more and will have to take a driving test to get my UK license. I am not super stoked about it, honestly. Things I'd never thought I would have to do again. I don't do that much driving but as its football season and Jhey has weekend games, I'd like to take the pup on some adventures. My US license is only good until November here in the UK so...time to get to it.

It's just the roundabouts man. I don't like the roundabouts. 

## Work 
Work is good, and I am busy but in a manageable way. I've said no to speaking at conferences the rest of the year after [State of the Browser](https://2024.stateofthebrowser.com/). For my own mental health, it's required. I will however be at AWE EU to represent Igalia and Wolvic. 

I'm getting to do some design work and hope to be able to share some of it soon. I'm trying to learn a little more about marketing, but time has been slim. Hoping to write some more posts about [Servo](https://servo.org/) and [Wolvic](https://wolvic.com/en/) this month.

## Vlogging
It's very hard to edit vlogs when you've been traveling as much as I have but I've been trying to catch up. My susbcriber count stalled which bums me out a bit but it is what it is.

Trying to tell a story is what I want to focus on next while I edit. 

## Currently... 

### Watching
- After being shown clips of Beth Dutton on TikTok I suggested we watch **Yellowstone**, and we were hooked. We haven't finished Season 5 yet but might wait until the rest of it comes out. 
- The Chi 

Surely there is more here but I can't recall. I mostly watched reruns of Yellowstone while traveling. 

### Playing

[Chicken Journey](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chicken-journey-switch/) on Nintendo Switch. An absolutely delightful little puzzle game. 

### Reading 
I picked up the pace on reading again after a bit of a lull and finished four books in August:
- [Dune Messiah](https://amzn.to/4eaDcai)
- [Rhythm of War (The Stormlight Archive)](https://amzn.to/3XiOHpc)
- [A Court of Thorns and Roses](https://amzn.to/4dTnvV8)
- [A Court of Mist and Fury](https://amzn.to/4evO6I3)

I dragged my feet on ACOTAR and finally decided to read it. It's now become my personality as I tend to do. It was the perfect follow up to Rhythm of War because Stormlight got a little slow for me and I struggled through the latter half of the book before it picked up again. 

ACOTAR is easy. It's fantasy with romance and people can dunk on it all they want, but I don't care. Sometimes a nice easy story is what you need. And I needed it. I'm a Rhysand fangirl now.
