Once upon a time, when I was younger, I used to heavily fixate on different things. Movies, books, TV shows...I don't think the level I would take it to was necessarily "normal" but I had quite the imagination and I remember my childhood and early teenage years in phases of what I was fixated on. 

For example, during my Egyptology phase that was, shall we say, intensified by the 1999 cinematic masterpiece, The Mummy, I wanted to paint my bedroom walls with scenes of the ancient Nile Delta. I had grand visions. When it was "I Dream of Jeannie", I wanted a room like the inside of Jeannie's bottle. When it was Tomb Raider, I wore my hair in a braid and spent the summer in shorts and top like Lara Croft's (but appropriate for my age), while reading and watching all I could on different civilizations and archaeology. 

It consumed what time I had outside of school and after-school activities. 

My career origin story starts with such a fixation, the LiveJournal Community and Photoshop. It may have been The X-Files or Harry Potter. I can't remember what thing exactly started it, but I remember scouring the internet for photos and fan websites, opening Photoshop and learning how to layer things. I learned how to make GIFs. I would make icon sets for LiveJournal avatars and share them in the communities for the fandoms. Best of all people liked my icons, so I felt like I had found a little outlet of joy and camaraderie online. 

I would later go on and use some of those icon sets in my first design portfolio reviews out of college. Fitting elements into a 100x100 pixel square is actually a really good design exercise.

It was a way to channel my creative energy when my parents wouldn't let me paint an elaborate scene onto the walls of my bedroom. 

## Online communities of yore

So what does this have to do with the internet of days past? Well, I'm feeling a little bit nostalgic. I have fallen headfirst into a new book universe in which I cannot consume the story fast enough. I feel some of that fixation energy from years ago, although lessened because, #adulting. 

When I search for this series...I am met with search results from big name sites. The top result is a Wikipedia page. The next is Amazon. Reddit. Tumblr. Etsy. 

Where have the fan sites gone? When we'd hobble together images from where we could and create an image gallery. Where have the online shrines gone? Consumed by ephemeral posts that disappear despite saving them. 

I have no bookmark folder of favorite websites to visit anymore. They are websites of necessity and utility. 

I still think of the X-Files Fan Fiction site, hosted by some loyal fan, now lost in the ether, from which I printed the largest stack of my favorite stories. I still have that stack. Like some precious artifact I won't give up. 

I remember when I could search for a thing and find an abundance of indie sites. Even on LiveJournal, I could search out my fellow fangirls and we'd share more than a love of a thing, but our creativity without expectation
