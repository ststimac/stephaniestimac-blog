"You look tired." 

Well, I'm pregnant and in the first trimester. I'm currently trying to prevent myself from throwing up, while needing to force myself eat every 2 hours despite not really exercising and needing to sleep for what seems like 12 hours a day all totaled up, and then there's the anxiety when something doesn't quite feel or look right. Then there's the intense aversion to foods and smells that were seemingly fine yesterday but today make me gag. I'm trying to participate in life like normal, but the brain fog has also rolled in, so I'm contending with that. Forgive me but yes, I'm tired, and I'm not going to hide it. Yes I'm excited. _We're_ excited. I'm still tired.
