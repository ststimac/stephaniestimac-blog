Early yesterday morning, on the second day of Blink On, I received the news that I had officially moved from Staff level to Pre-Partner at Igalia. This largely means that I now participate in decision-making with the rest of those Igalians who are pre-partners and partners. 

I received what feels like a waterfall of new information and new responsibilities. This is good and exciting! 

You should always celebrate your wins and a title or level change. 

Lots of people will tell you title doesn't matter, but those people are lying to you. _Especially_ if they are in big tech. However, I care about my title at Igalia for different reasons than I cared about my title at Microsoft. 

I can participate more fully and with more impact. 

Cheers to that.
