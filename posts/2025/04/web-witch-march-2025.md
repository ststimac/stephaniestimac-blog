I really haven't done a review of my months since November. I've been deep in hibernation mode, conserving energy for what will be a busy few months. I started to write a log about what happened in March, the first March that did not drag on this year, at least for me, but now it's May and April was precisely what I was expecting it to be: exhausting. I'm still recovering from our trip to Seattle at the end of April. 

## Manchester United (March)
We took a day trip up to Manchester and went to a FA Cup game against Fulham, and despite Man Utd losing, we had a good time. We didn't really have time to go into Manchester and just drove back south after. I quite enjoyed hearing the entire stadium break out in "Country Roads, Take Me Home" with locations modified to be Manchester related. 


## State of the Browser (March)


## BlinkOn (April)

## Seattle (April)
Not necessarily a vacation. We headed back to the PNW so that I could try and sort out my storage unit since plans to return to Seattle (and live), for the time being, are not in the immediate future. Though I still dream of having a place in West Seattle, and we haven't ruled it out. It's just not the right time. So I spent 4 days going through boxes and boxes of things, donating nearly half the contents of the unit. I managed to get things down to about 12 totes, a chest full of glassware and collectibles, and a couch I can't seem to let go of.

There were a few tears and I completely crashed in the evening from emotional and physical exhaustion.

### Birding

We usually make time to grab a coffee and go walk Lincoln Park in West Seattle when we visit. Now that I'm full on into birding, it was like discovering an entirely new place. There are so many pretty birds around! We spotted quite a few and our favorites were the black-capped chickadee and the spotted towhee.

### Watching

Jhey hadn't watched _The White Lotus_, and I never finished season 2. We did a watch of both seasons in preparation for season 3 and despite traveling during the finale, I managed to avoid spoilers. 

- _MobLand_ - Really good. I wasn't sure after the first two episodes but having just finished episode 5, it's got me hooked. 
- _Wheel of Time_ - I haven't finished the season yet, and I spoiled the finale for myself on accident. As a book reader, I had started to enjoy season 3 but knowing what I know has once again left me disppointed with the series.
