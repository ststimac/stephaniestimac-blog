My goal for 2024 was to read 30 books. I had set a stretch goal despite not meeting my 2023 goal. I finished 31 books in 2024 and I am _damn_ proud of that. I found myself prioritizing reading and having more time to do so. Perhaps it was finally abandoning Twitter, after realizing it's descent into a toxic cesspool was no longer reversible, and finding that when you're not scrolling mindlessly or trying to chase the algorithm you can get a lot done. 




## The One That Left An Impact: [_Over the Edge: Death in the Grand Canyon_](https://amzn.to/4fwIA7R)

After visiting the Grand Canyon in October 2023, I picked up this book in January 2024 while in Arizona preparing to bring my dog to England. A rather morbid topic at face value, analyzing all the ways people have died in the Grand Canyon, whether by accident or hubris or unfortunate mishaps. The historical account of the Canyon paired with all these stories (550 deaths are covered in the book) makes for a rather fascinating read. Having witnessed people make poor decisions along the Canyon's edge while visiting, it's so easy to see why there have been so many deaths. An absolute must read if you've ever been or are planning to visit. It instills some respect for the Canyon. 

## The One That I Didn't Expect to Love: [_A Court of Thorns and Roses_]()
After finishing Stormlight Archive's _Rhythm of War_, I felt a bit lost on what to read next. While I do love epic fantasy, sometime it can get a bit tedious. I had seen _A Court of Thorns and Roses_ pop up occasionally on socials, and a sample had been sitting on my Kindle for sometime. It completely swept me away and I fell head first into the romantasy genre. While ACOTAR is not my favorite of the romantasy I've read, it opened up a whole new world of easy to read fantasy without the overhead of epic fantasy, and sometimes that's just what I need to read. 

## The One That Broke My Heart: [_Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How It Changed the World_](https://amzn.to/4fF7UZu)

In 2020 my brother recommended reading this book. I bought it but had put off reading it. It broke my heart because it felt like I was reading about COVID. The exact same things happened with flu deniers, people revolting against mask mandates and ignoring quarantine rules. 102 years between each one and humans responded the same way. 

## The One That Changed My Perspective: [_Ranger Confidential: Living, Working, And Dying In The National Parks_](https://amzn.to/4j6aGd6)

After reading the Grand Canyon book, I was intrigued by this Ranger's memoir sitting on my parents' coffee table. It was an easy and short read and opened my eyes to incredibly difficult and dangerous situations Park Rangers have to deal with, often because people think the rules don't apply to them. I have a much deeper respect for National Park Rangers after reading this book. 

## The One(s) That I Couldn't Put Down: [_Fourth Wing_](https://amzn.to/3DHZQdg) and [_The Songbird and the Heart of Stone (Crowns of Nyaxia Book 3_)](https://amzn.to/3DS4dSR)

### Fourth Wing
I loved Fourth Wing but particularly loved the dragons and their personalities. Another romantasy, enemies to lovers trope, and I now understand what a Shadow Daddy is (lol). Someone had told me Fourth Wing is supposed to be 50 Shades with dragons. I've never read 50 Shades of Grey but know of its reputation and generally poor writing. Based on what I know of 50 Shades, I have to say this is (most likely) nothing like it. 

### The Songbird and the Heart of Stone
I was uncertain I was going to love this book because it follows a secondary character from the first two books in the series. I ended up loving the journey these vampires have to go on and mythological components to this story. I can't wait for the follow up.

## 2025 Book Goals
I'm going for 40 books this year. ACOTAR ignited an even more voracious love of reading and I have already finished two books. 

I'm still on [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35259023-stephanie-stimac), and I want to love StoryGraph but the app UI on mobile is a bit rough to navigate. 

What are your book goals this year? Let me know on socials. Happy new year!
