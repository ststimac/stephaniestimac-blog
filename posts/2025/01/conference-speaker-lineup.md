If your response to a lineup dominated by men is, "There are almost no women in this field," I'm afraid that reveals a lack of effort to curate an event with diverse, interesting perspectives. It suggests you haven’t prioritized thoughtful research or meaningful outreach—and if you’re not putting care into the core experience of your event, that likely extends to every other aspect of it.

If only men are submitting CFPs to your event, that’s a sign of a deeper issue that needs addressing. It could stem from something as simple as a visibility problem or as serious as toxicity in the surrounding culture—or even within your team. Identifying and fixing this requires effort and introspection. Running a great event that attracts a wide audience takes **hard** work.

So if your answer to "why are only men submitting CFPs to my event?" is that "there are no women in this field", I can't imagine you actually care enough to fix the problem. Because there are countless talented people who **aren’t men** working as developers, and such a response speaks to laziness rather than reality.

I would also beg that you not take your demographic information from things like the State of JS/CSS/HTML/Whatever Framework Surveys, because those represent a very small slice of developers out of a [reported 27 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/627312/worldwide-developer-population/) web developers worldwide. 

Ask your connections or research similar events. **Do the work.**   

But for all that is holy, do not respond with "there are no women in this field" because there absolutely are and that is poor excuse not based in reality.
