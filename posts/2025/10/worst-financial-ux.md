Getting approved for a credit card in the UK has been a laborious struggle. Your credit history is country dependent, and while you have an advantage if you were an Amex cardholder in the US, this wasn't enough to get approved in the UK on my own and I needed to wait until I had completed a tax year to get a UK Amex. So while I was waiting for the time to pass, I applied for a Monzo Flex. It gave me a £500 limit. Okay, great, that was a start. 

But the thing about the £500 limit it's not very useful when you're trying to make a larger purchase online. So after about a year, I applied for a UK BarclayCard because I had a large purchase I wanted to make online. The online application process was fairly quick and painless, and I was approved rather quickly. So I happily waited for my card to me mailed, excited I could finally have a UK card of my own, that wasn't a joint credit card, to use for large purchases when needed. 

Unfortunately, that's when this experience all started to fall apart.

I received my card within a day, again, excited it arrived so quickly. I exclaimed as much to Jhey, showing him the card. And then he flipped open a piece of documentation with my limit. Online it said my limit was £1200. The mailer instead said £200. My face dropped. Well then, that was a waste of my time. 

And then an email came through saying my limit had been increased based on other documentation I had provided. Oh okay, we're all good then. But I had to go activate my card in an ATM before use. I haven't had to do that in a while, but I was going out anyway, so I made a stop and put my card in an ATM, pressed some buttons and went home. I tried to use my card for my purchase online and it just...failed. No matter what I tried, no websites would take my card. It's like the security process kept failing. I wasn't getting a text to approve the purchase. Nothing was showing up in the app. It just failed. 

Speaking of the app, that in itself was a nightmare to deal with. I'm on an iPhone bought in America with everything running through the US App Store. The Barclaycard app is only available on the UK app store, so I had to work some Apple account magic to download it (while praying nothing from the US app store got wiped.) I logged into the app and was met with a rather sparse UI. Some details were there. Some weren't. I tried to figure out if there was a way to set up purchase authorization notifications. 

I was then introduced to this thing called PINsentry. Some little device that verifies your identity that I obviously do not have as an immigrant in the UK. Jhey had one though, and I was able to verify my card and identity with it. Hooray! Maybe now I can use my card?

No. I couldn't. I've activated it. I've put it in an ATM. I've logged into my online account so many times I'm getting sick of their fake 2FA solution and nothing is working. 

I decide to give it a day, so I stop trying to make my purchase. 

The next day, my app UI has changed. Menu items have disappeared, new ones are in its place. My card is kind of there but when I go to view "My Cards" it says I have no cards and to call. I've managed to make a small Amazon purchase and use my card at a beauty appointment. But when I try to make my big purchase online, it fails again. No notifications for approval are sent. The website looks like it's trying to send me a code by connected to mastercard, but it just fails. 

Once again, I decide to wait another day, but I'm aggravated at this point. On day 3, it still doesn't work, and I end up using the Amex I share with Jhey to make my purchase.

I tuck my Barclaycard into my wallet because that's the other thing, I haven't been able to add it to ApplePay because verification fails and there's no documentation about how to fix it or even complete it.
